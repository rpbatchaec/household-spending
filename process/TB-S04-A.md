# Troubleshooting Branch — TB-S04-A
_Last updated: 2025-09-13_

⚠️ **Note**: This is a ChatGPT/log branch, NOT a Git branch.  
You are still working on the `main` branch of your Git repo.  
This branch exists only to isolate troubleshooting context in ChatGPT.

**Anchor Step**: S04 (from Master Runbook)  
**Environment**: Windows 11 24H2 (Build 26100.6584) | PowerShell 5.1.26100.6584 | Python 3.13.7 | VS Code 1.104.0 (x64) | Git 2.51.0.windows.1  
**Repo**: `C:\Users\rpbat\repo\household-spending`  
**Symptom**: Kernel not visible in VS Code or stuck on 'Detecting Kernels'.

## 1) Evidence
- Paste exact error text
- Add screenshot(s): `docs\S04\error.png`
- Last commands run (copy/paste)
- Relevant logs (VS Code → *Output*: Jupyter/Python/Git)

## 2) Hypotheses (ordered)
1. 
2. 
3. 

## 3) Triage Plan (fastest first)
- [ ] Quick check #1 (1–2 min)
- [ ] Quick check #2
- [ ] Minimal repro in new temp folder (`%TEMP%\repro-S04`) with fresh venv
- [ ] Controlled test (disable extensions / antivirus if allowed)

## 4) Fix Attempts (one at a time)
- Action → Outcome → New evidence

## 5) Exit Criteria
- [ ] Anchor step reproduces expected behavior
- [ ] Regression checks on adjacent steps pass
- [ ] Permanent fix documented in Master Runbook (Evidence column)
- [ ] Close branch and **resume at S04**

## Re-entry snippet
```
Resume Master Runbook at S04. Anchor TB-S04-A is closed.
Show the next 2 steps with preconditions, commands, expected outputs, and quick exit checks.
```
